In this analysis, we decided to build a regression model on variable “stars” in the review dataset from variables in user and business dataset. We limited our target to Chinese restaurants with a price range under $60 dollars. Our goal is to build a model to list out restaurant recommendations for Yelp individual customers based on customer preferences and restaurant attributes. To be more specific, the model recommends restaurants for an individual based on his/her previous records of reviews on restaurants rather than the overall review of a restaurant rated by the public.
